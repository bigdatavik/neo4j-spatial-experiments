1	Elk Island Till Study, 1964	In 1964, the ARC drilled 155 boreholes just east of Elk Island National Park. The project was intended to characterize the geochemistry of the area (Bayrock and Pawluk, 1969). The logs were never published.	L.A. Bayrock, S. Pawluk, D. Lennox, and T.W.

2	Red Earth, 1997	Five boreholes were drilled for drift characterization to support diamond exploration in the 1990s (Pawlowicz and Fenton, 1998).

3	Buffalo Head Hills/Sawn Lake, 2002	Eleven auger coreholes were drilled to obtain information on the Quaternary stratigraphy and glacial dispersion of kimberlite indicator minerals (KIMs) within the Buffalo Head Hills kimberlite field. The core was sampled for geochemical, texture, and KIM analyses. In addition, palynology samples were collected from the bedrock (Pawlowicz et al., 2005).

4	High Level, 1993	Six holes were drilled to determine the regional variations in the texture, indicator minerals, and geochemistry of till in northern Alberta, to assist exploration by industry for diamondiferous kimberlite and lamproite, gold placers, and other minerals (Fenton and Pawlowicz, 1998).

5	Peace River, 1995	Nine boreholes were drilled to characterize the Quaternary stratigraphy in the Peace River region. Samples were taken for geochemical and diamond indicator mineral analysis (Pawlowicz et al., 1996).

6	Pelican, 2000	Eight locations were drilled in summer 2000, but the logs were never published. No geophysical logging was done on the holes.	Pawlowicz and Fenton, J.E. Campbell	diamond indicator minerals, till geochemistry, Quaternary stratigraphy	No	10					
7	Wabasca, 1998	Eight boreholes were drilled to characterize the Quaternary stratigraphy in the Wabasca area (at 7 locations). Samples were taken for geochemical and diamond indicator mineral analysis, grain size analysis, and matrix carbonate (Pawlowicz et al., 1998).

14	Quaternary Stratigraphy, Southern Alberta, 1981-83	Fifty eight boreholes were drilled to characterize the Quaternary stratigraphy of the southern half of the province. Two 1:500 000 scale maps were ultimately produced (Shetsen, 1987 and Shetsen 1990) as well as a research paper (Shetsen, 1984). The logs were never published.	I. Shetsen, J. Olic	pebble count; till pebble lithology, glacial history	No	58					
33	Peerless Lake, 2001	Two holes were drilled to characterize the Quaternary stratigraphy in  the Peerless Lake map area (NTS 84B). Samples were taken for geochemical analysis, and  geophysical logging was done on the holes. The logs were never published.	Pawlowicz, Fenton	Quaternary stratigraphy	No	2					
36	Calling Lake, 1999	Two holes were drilled in the Calling Lake area as part of a regional Quaternary stratigraphy program. Samples were taken and geochemistry analyzed. Geophysical logging was done on both holes. The logs were never published.	Pawlowicz, Meeks	Quaternary stratigraphy	No	2					
58	Fort McMurray Gypsum Testholes, 1968	In 1968, two holes were drilled by the Alberta Research Council near Fort McMurray to characterize the quality and extent of gypsum deposits underlying the Clearwater Formation. The holes are also recorded in the WWID (Hamilton, 1968).
