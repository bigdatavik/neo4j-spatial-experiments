  Description: 
    Abstract: Since its inception in 1920, the Alberta Geological Survey (AGS) has drilled several thousand boreholes across the province. Most were drilled only into the unconsolidated sediments overlying the top of bedrock. In 2010, AGS staff began a project to systematically compile all of the borehole log information into a database. This Digital Data product and its companion Open File Report, OFR 2014-06 are the interim results of this initiative.
The dataset comprises three tables: Sources.txt, Boreholes.txt and Intervals.txt, as well as metadata. The Sources table gives summary information about the AGS project for which each borehole was drilled. The Boreholes table gives summary information about each borehole, such as location, drilling method, date, and total depth of the hole. The Intervals table gives descriptive geological information about each distinct geological horizon encountered in the borehole, including lithology and colour of the material. The tables have primary keys on them so they may be loaded into a relational database, GIS system, or geological modelling program. This dataset is an interim release of 266 boreholes.
    Purpose: For computer display, query and modelling of AGS borehole data.

Data Quality Information: 
  Attribute Accuracy: 
    Attribute Accuracy Report: Attribute values were checked periodically during the digitization process using query tools in MS Access, by spell-checking in MS Excel, and visual inspection of check plots of strip logs produced using ViewLog software. Where possible, constraints were placed on attribute domains to minimize digitizing errors.
  Logical Consistency Report: This is a compilation of data from many project sources. Project areas may overlap. Only boreholes that could be located with confidence are included in this dataset, including holes re-drilled at a given location because of drilling difficulties. No attempt has been made to standardize attribute values within and among project datasets. Log data are the observations of many different geologists over many decades.
  Completeness Report: These data comprise approximately 3.5% of the total number of holes drilled by the AGS since 1920. We intend to publish further sets as we complete the digitization of the remaining holes.
  Positional Accuracy: 
    Horizontal Positional Accuracy: 
      Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report: Location accuracy of holes varies widely throughout this dataset, ranging from +/- 25 - 400 m. Each hole is tagged with the compiler's estimate of its positional precision, as values in the Boreholes table's [Spatial_Precision] field.
    Vertical Positional Accuracy: 
      Vertical Positional Accuracy Report: There are many sources of uncertainty associated with depth accuracy of borehole data and a full discussion is beyond the scope of this document. Depth accuracy is a function of drilling method, sampling/drilling interval size, and experience and judgement of the logging geologist. Most of the interval data in this data set is recorded as it appears on the original log with the following exceptions. In instances where the amount of core recovered is greater or less than the drilled depth, adjustments were made to described interval top and bottom depths. This adjustment was made to intervals of data source IDs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 33 and 36.

    Process Step: 
      Process Description: Two source data types were processed:
1. Unpublished, paper files: Source data included paper borehole logs and maps on file with AGS staff. Logs were scanned to PDF and named according to borehole number on the log, with prefix "Litholog_". 
2. Logs previously published in PDF format: The following SourceIDs have been previously published by AGS or other journals: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 58. Individual logs were saved to PDF and named according to borehole number on the log, with prefix "Litholog_".
      Process Date: 2010
    Process Step: 
      Process Description: Some borehole data had been digitized before the start of this project for use in other AGS studies. Borehole locations not already in digital format were compiled in ArcGIS from scanned maps, georeferenced using the digital provincial township fabric as a base. In many cases the maps showing hole locations are inaccurate at larger scales, which results in holes plotting in the middle of cultivated fields. In such unlikely cases hole positions were refined by manually placing them at the nearest road intersection, which is logically where a drill rig would have been sited. We also used SPOT 2008 imagery as a backdrop in ArcGIS to better place the hole within an LSD or quarter section. Borehole attribute information was compiled in Excel and loaded into MS Access.
      Process Date: 2010
    Process Step: 
      Process Description:  Descriptive data of geologic intervals were typed into MS Excel, then uploaded to MS Access. Data were checked and corrected where necessary by plotting strip logs of the interval data using ViewLog software.
