    "# Computing Walk Score With Open Street Map and Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this experiment is to see if it is possible to construct a methodology for computing a specific Walk Score for communities immediately surrouding buidlings.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these data are available on the [Walkscore website](https://www.walkscore.com/), the intent of this experiement is to validate a baseline methdology applying Neo4j Spatial against a known metric. This then can provide a foundation for processing and analyzing other forms of metrics for computing community wellbeing metrics and/or blending or aumenting baseline walkscore beyond its simple foundation. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also wanted to try to visualize how a community changes over time by connecting Neo4j to the [Deck.gl](http://deck.gl/#/) visualizaiton framework. \n",

    "\n",
    "- [Neo4j Open Street Map Importer](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/osm)\n",
    "- [Deck.gl](http://deck.gl/#/)\n",
    "- [Neo4j Community Edition](https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j/) via Docker. \n",

    "## Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to get a running neo4j instance loaded with demo data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Unzip the Neo4j database: neo4j-data/databases/graph.db.zip \n",
    "\n",
    "In the root of this repo, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker-compose up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start the Neo4j database, and the Deck.gl container. \n",

    "See [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) for configuration of the neo4j instance in docker. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The Neo4j database was small enough for this example to be checked in with the repo, so everything should be good to go.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and Development \n",
    "\n",
    "I used the [Open Stree Map Editor](https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=16/51.0532/-114.0623) to export the base data for the City of Calgary. I have stored the raw Open Stree Map data in the datasources folder as well for reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used Craig's [Open Street Map Processor Source Code](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/osm) to pull in the Open Street Map data for the Calgary region for this example. I then followed the steps outlined in the slide deck and the presentation from [Graph Connect](https://neo4j.com/graphconnect-2018/session/neo4j-spatial-mapping) to post-process the OSM data. You can follow Craig's process to do this with any Open Street Map data and I have also put the Periodic Iterate versions of the steps into the repo as well for reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then generated Points of Interest for Amenities based on the list outlined in the Walk Score algorithm Document (see the Documentation Folder) using the query in 3_amenities. \n",

    "I generated a RawScore rank for the amenities:\n",
    "\n",

    "This is a very basic Deck.gl visualzation just to get the connectivity working between neo4j and deck. I plan to do some more interesting things on subsequent posts. This basic visualizaition shows Amenities over Time in downtown Calgary for 2010,2014 and 2018. You can see how the number of amenities increases over the eight year period. \n",

    "\n",
    "The following is derived from the Walk Score documents found in the Documentaiton folder. I may still not have the calculation completely bang on as I think there is an additional weighting characteristic associated with the number of amenities in each collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Walk Score® is scaled linearly, ranging from: \n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 to 24 “car-dependent” (car required for almost all errands), \n",
    "- 25–49 “car-dependent” (car required for most errands), \n",

    "\n",
    "Walk Score® = Raw Score/15 x 6.67 - (ID - ABL)\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw score is composed of nine amenity categories of walking destinations (grocery, restaurants, shopping, coffee shops, bank services, schools, entertainment, bookstores, and parks) each weighted from one to three points based on low, medium, or high importance for walking in six research articles referenced by Walk Score®\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores within each category were attenuated by a close approximation of the Walk Score® distance decay function awarding:\n",
    "\n",

    "- 75% within 0.5 miles (800 m or 10 min), \n",
    "- 40% within 0.75 miles (1200 m or 15 min), \n",
    "- 12.5% within 1.0 mile (1600m or 20min) of each location (Walk Score, 2012)\n",
    "\n",
    "The weighting of three categories (restaurants, shopping, and coffee shops) reflects the number of destinations available (or “depth of choice”) (Walk Score, 2012). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the Walk Score® intersection density (ID) function was used to deduct a maximum 5% penalty for 60 intersections per square mile and the Walk Score® average block length (ABL) function was used to deduct the Same maximum of 5% for N195 m length per block.\n",

The A* algorithm for example makes it possible to use route finding between buidling and amenities instead of relying on abstractions for assessing walkability of a neighborhood. In effect - the computation theoretically becomes more accurate as the algorithm is in effect sending an 'agent' down the actual path between the building and all potential amenities. \n",
